				<h1><u>Steps Undertaken</u></h1>

<h2 style=" text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-decoration: ">We followed a step-by-step process where we divided the project in the following four parts:</p>
</h2>

<h2 style=" text-align: justify;">
<u>Responsiveness:
</u></h2>


 <div class="cards">
		<p>       
•	Responsivess was a challenge for us as apart from some casual interaction with HTML, our team has never worked on CSS leave alone applying responsiveness.</br>  
•	According to our research we fonud that responsive web design is made up from three basic elements:<b></br> </br> 
1.	Flexible Grid:</b></br>  
CSS's grid system is responsive. The columns will re-arrange automatically depending on the screen size: On a big screen it might look better with the content organized in 
three columns, but on a small screen it might be better if the content were stacked on top of each other. So, in according to the ideology, to represent the skills of each participant we 
employed the Flexbox layout.</b></br></br> <b>  
2.	Flexible Media:</b></br>  
Flexible images fairly straight forward to get running responsively when compared with getting the iframes going. With the advent of responsive design, there are lot of interactive
elements. We used some of them such as:Images — &lt;img&gt;, etc. </b></br></br><b>  
3.	Media Queries</b></br>  
The @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media types.Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored 
style sheet to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones (such as iPhone and Android phones). All the 
polular browsers version that fully supports the @media rule. Media queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they look at the capability 
of the device. So, for example, we utilised them by changing the width of the page according to the device when the pixels become less than 530 px.</br></p>

<u>Usability:
</u></h2>


<div class="cards">
		<p> <b>
1. Simple and To the point:</b></br>
 The simpler the website, more better it is. Our website has more understanding and less interpretation</br><b></br>
 
2. Navigation is clear accurate:</br></b>
 Our website has a regular design with proper links and navigation tools making it easy to operate. End user will find it appealing if they could easily get the flow of direction. We made the eternal links to open in a new tab as these links takes user to a differet website.
 Intenal links open in same tab as its part of same website.</br></br> <b>
 
3. Responsiveness:</b></br>
 Web world has large number of device setting and so website needs to be compatible for view in the mediums like different smartphones and tablets so that the users can have best online experience.</br></br> <b>
 
4. Visual appeal:</b></br>
 A good website must be visually appealing to end user. We used different images and text colours to create a good effect. </br>  </br>

<h2 style=" text-align: justify;">
<u>Content:
</u></h2>

 <div class="cards">
		<p>
Our website is about our team. We are three team members - Poonam Krishna, Yashjeet Singh and Shreyas Dalvi and our website gives the details of each of the team members, our work 
experience. and our current academic standing. There is a dedicated webpage for each member and the home page has the links to navigate to these pages.
The details page has educations, skillset, professional experience and projects. Some external links like Github and Linkedin are also present in the details page and opens on separate
windows.</p>

<u>Design:
</u></h2>


 <div class="cards">
		<p><b>    
1.	Simplicity:</b></br>  
Our primary goal was to bring simplify the design. The plan was to make it look presentable and aesthetic with as few lines of code as possible; i.e, achieve maximum efficiency 
with minimum effort. So, that's why we only employed HTML, CSS and not JS as we wanted  to learn and apply.</br></br> <b>  
2.	Conventionality:</b></br>  
There are some website architecture traditions which, throughout the years, web clients have turned out to be progressively familiar with. While it was tempting to forgo the existing 
design conventions, we believe it might lead to confusion among users. We wanted to keep the familiarity alive so that users can easily navigate. So, using that, we placed the 
Home and Contact Me links at the bottom.</b></br></br><b>  
3.	Consistency:</b></br>  
In our opinion, the look and feel of any website must be uniform across all the web pages. Attributes such as backgrounds, color schemes, typefaces, and even the tone of your writing 
are all areas where being consistent can have a positive impact on the user's reaction to the website's UX. So, we placed the same backgroud for each page but changed the layout for each 
page.</br></p>
